# TypeScript Next.js React App

Welcome to [Your App Name]! This is a TypeScript-based Next.js application built with React.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (at least version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   If you're using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   If you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This command starts the development server at `http://localhost:3000/`. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically hot-reloaded, allowing for a smooth development experience.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This command generates an optimized production build of your application.

To start the production server, run:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

### Additional Scripts

- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`: Lints the TypeScript code using ESLint.
- `npm run format` or `yarn format`: Formats the TypeScript code using Prettier.

### Folder Structure

- `pages/`: Contains Next.js pages. Each file in this directory corresponds to a route in the application.
- `components/`: Contains React components used throughout the application.
- `styles/`: Contains global stylesheets or CSS modules.
- `public/`: Contains static assets such as images, fonts, etc.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions or modules used across the application.
- `types/`: Contains TypeScript type definitions.

### Customize Configuration

You can customize the Next.js configuration by modifying the `next.config.js` file.
